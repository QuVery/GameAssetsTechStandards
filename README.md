# Game Dev Tech Standards

An open-source guide and toolset for establishing and validating technical standards in game development.

## Introduction

This repository aims to be a comprehensive resource for game developers in understanding and implementing technical standards across various domains like 2D graphics, 3D modeling, VFX, Shaders, and Audio. It also includes standalone validation tools to ensure assets and code meet the prescribed standards.

## A Note on Creativity and Exploration

While this repository aims to provide well-established guidelines and best practices in game development, it's important to remember that the field is ever-evolving. These standards represent paths that have been crossed by others and found to be effective, but they aren't the only paths available.

We highly encourage you to use this resource as a starting point or a reference, but don't let it limit your creativity and willingness to explore new solutions. The greatest innovations often come from questioning established norms and daring to try something different.

So go ahead, use these guidelines as a foundation, but never hesitate to experiment and discover potentially better approaches that could revolutionize the way we think about game development.

## Usage
